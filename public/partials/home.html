      Game of Globes
      <span class="text-muted">This is not your father's capture-the-flag.</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Get the other team's Globe (which is an 8 foot tall beach wall) in your
      goal area, but don't let the other team grab yours! Games are timed and
      the team that captures the other team's globe the most times wins. Game of
      Globes is the featured game at Collide-O-Sphere and is a sure fire way to
      have a great time in an original way!
